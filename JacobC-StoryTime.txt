I went fishing with my dad when I was young.
We went to the lake.
We tried fishing for hours, but caught nothing.
When we finally decided to leave and the sun was setting, fish began to jump out of the water.
We cast our line a final time and caught three fish.
We had a fun time, despite our slow day.
